                Hi, I'm Hugh Pien! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px" />
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am new to the HTML, CSS, Java, JS environment. However I have been coing in .NET with C# for over 10+
                years.
                I am a Results-driven and team-oriented Fullstack Software Engineer.
                Proven expertise in full-stack development (C#, .NET, SQL) and architecting robust API integrations for
                large-scale data exchange.
                Leveraging a decade of experience in the tech industry, I am eager to apply my robust problem-solving
                skills to the new position.
